# RadioLogger

This is a Radio hobby logging app that is created with PostgreSQL, ExpressJS, REACT, NodeJS (PERN) and MaterialUI stack.

This can be used for AM/MW Radio DX, Shortwave Radio Listening/DX, VHF & UHF contacts.

It will also go along with a project database to include all published frequency reference data in the 40 volumes of Passport to World Band Radio.  In the future, we will add data from the World Radio and TV Handbook (WRTH) and possibly data from other publications and peridicals like Popular Communications, 73 Magazine, QST, Monitoring Times, etc..
